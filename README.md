  It is an html-page with all cities with acceptable conditions and weather forecast for nearest Friday Saturday and Sunday.

Here is the answer generated at `20.04.2017`:

Also you can look at the file `optimal_cities.to_travel(0-24).html`. It is html-page, containing answers generated at `20.04.2017` with
available temperatures `[0, 24]` (just to see what happens if there are many answers, because for our task conditions there are quite few answers).

__USEFUL COMMENTS ABOUT PROGRAM__
